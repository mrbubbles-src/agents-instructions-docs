- Place shared types under `types/`, named `feature-name.d.ts`.
- Keep component props types in their own files, using the format `ComponentProps` (e.g., `SidebarProps`).
- Do not prematurely extract one-off types.
- Do not use `any` type unless absolutely necessary.
- Do not use `unknown` type unless absolutely necessary.
- Do not use `never` type unless absolutely necessary.
